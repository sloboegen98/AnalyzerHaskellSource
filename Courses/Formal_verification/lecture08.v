(*** Adhoc polymorphism *)

(** * Parametric vs adhoc polymorphism *)

(** Parametric polymorphism is a way to write
    generic functions which work independently
    of the concrete type of the inputs.

    Example: [rev] function on sequences.
 *)

Check @rev : forall (T : Type), seq T -> seq T.

(** Since there is no way for [rev] function to depend
    on concrete values of the elements of the input
    sequence we can conclude that the function' output
    consists of the elements of the input sequence.

    More on this can be found in the paper
    "Theorems for Free" (1989) by P. Wadler
 *)

(** But sometimes we want different behaviours
    for different types.
    The classical example of this is the decidable
    equality operation.
